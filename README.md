# Sun-Seeking-Dryer-Robot

This is a group project done under the module EN1190 Engineering Design project, Semester 2 of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.

1. Introduction
   
- This dryer is designed to transform the conventional approach to drying spices, shoes, and other items in both rural and urban households. By integrating an advanced sun tracking system using Light-Dependent Resistors (LDR) sensors, this dryer autonomously follows the sun's movement throughout the day, ensuring optimal exposure to sunlight for efficient and eco-friendly drying.

2. Key Features
- Automatic Sun Tracking: The dryer utilizes cutting-edge LDR sensors to precisely follow the sun's position, optimizing the drying process without manual intervention.

- Energy-Efficient: This system utilizes sunlight, a renewable energy source, reducing environmental impact and providing a sustainable solution for households.

- Effortless Drying: The Sun Seeking Dryer simplifies the drying process, making it accessible to everyone in the community.
